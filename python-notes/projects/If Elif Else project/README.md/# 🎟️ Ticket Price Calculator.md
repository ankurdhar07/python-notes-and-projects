# 🎟️ Ticket Price Calculator

This is a simple Python program that calculates the ticket price based on the user's **age** and **time of day** (Morning, Afternoon, or Evening). It's a great beginner-level project that demonstrates the use of `if-elif-else` conditions and user input.

---

## 📌 How It Works

1. The user is asked to input their **age**.
2. Then, the user enters the **time of day** — either **Morning**, **Afternoon**, or **Evening**.
3. Based on the age and time, the program calculates the ticket price using conditional logic.
4. Finally, the ticket price is printed.

## 💡 Ticket Pricing Logic

| Age Group     | Morning | Afternoon | Evening |
|---------------|---------|-----------|---------|
| 0 - 12        | ₹100    | ₹120      | ₹150    |
| 13 - 18       | ₹150    | ₹170      | ₹200    |
| 19 and above  | ₹200    | ₹250      | ₹300    |

## 🛠️ Sample Output

Enter your age: 16
Enter time of day (Morning / Afternoon / Evening): evening
Your Ticket Price Is 200
