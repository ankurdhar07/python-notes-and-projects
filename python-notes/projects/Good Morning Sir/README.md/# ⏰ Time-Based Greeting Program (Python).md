# ⏰ Time-Based Greeting Program (Python)

This is a simple Python script that automatically greets the user based on the current system time.

## 🧠 How It Works

The program uses the `datetime` module to fetch the current hour from your system clock. Based on the time of day, it greets the user with:

- **Good morning sir** – if the time is between 5:00 AM and 11:59 AM
- **Good evening sir** – if the time is between 12:00 PM and 3:59 PM
- **Good afternoon sir** – if the time is between 4:00 PM and 5:59 PM
- **Good night sir** – for any other time

## 🧪 Example Output


*(The actual greeting depends on your system time.)*

## 💻 Technologies Used

- Python 3
- `datetime` module (built-in)

## 📌 Use Case

Perfect for beginner-level Python practice and understanding how to work with system time and conditionals.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Make sure Python is installed on your system.
2. Save the script in a `.py` file (e.g. `greeting.py`)
3. Open terminal and run:

```bash
python greeting.py
⚠️ Note
This script depends on your device's local system time.
