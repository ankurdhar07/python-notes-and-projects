# Python `for` Loop

## ðŸ“Œ Introduction
The `for` loop in Python is used to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, string, or range) and execute a block of code for each element in that sequence.

## ðŸ›  Syntax
```python
for variable in sequence:
    # Code to execute for each element
ðŸ“– How It Works
1. Iteration: The loop picks one element from the sequence at a time.

2. Code Execution: Executes the loop body with the current element.

3. Repeat: Moves to the next element until all elements are processed.

4. Stop: The loop ends when there are no more elements.

5. Optional else: Runs once after the loop finishes naturally (without break).

âœ… Key Points
- Commonly used with range() for numeric loops.

- Can loop through any iterable (list, tuple, string, dictionary, etc.).

- Use break to exit early and continue to skip to the next iteration.
