# Python `while` Loop

## ðŸ“Œ Introduction
The `while` loop in Python is used to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a given condition is `True`.

## ðŸ›  Syntax
```python
while condition:
    # Code to execute repeatedly
ðŸ“– How It Works
1. Condition Check: Before each iteration, the condition is evaluated.

2. Code Execution: If the condition is True, the loop body runs.

3. Repeat: After executing, the condition is checked again.

4. Stop: When the condition becomes False, the loop ends.

5. Optional else: A while loop can have an else block, which executes once when the loop ends naturally (without break).

âœ… Key Points
- Make sure the loop condition will eventually become False to avoid an infinite loop.

- You can use break to exit the loop early.

- You can use continue to skip the current iteration and move to the next.
